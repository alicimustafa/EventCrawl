The website allows for a new user to register an account and perform a variety of CRUD operations in order to create, edit, or delete their personal information, groups, events, etc. Please create an account and populate it with data or sign in as "Cage" with username "1234" to see a testing account.

## Objective
The final project conducted at skill distillery is designed to showcase all the technologies learned throughout the course of the program. Crawl came from an app idea regarding the desire to be part of a group that could create events where a bar crawl route is mapped out and communication for planning is facilitated. Crawl could be used for any group of people with a common route in mind thanks to the flexibility of web app construction and the Google Maps API.
