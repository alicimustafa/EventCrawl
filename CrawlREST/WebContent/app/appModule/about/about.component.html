<p>Four,</br>

Four </br>
Thats the number that walked through the door,</br>
The number of people who formed the core,</br>
The number of people who will make your jaws drop to the floor,</br>

Stan</br>
He came from a distant land,</br>
He left his clan, </br>
In hopes of being better than an also ran </br>

One </br>
One would not have been enough to get this done,</br>
One would not have been enough to have any fun,</br>
One would still be working, out from the light of the sun</br>

Dan</br>
He too sacrificed like Stan,</br>
He too types this all with his hand, </br>
He too came here to understand.</br>

Two</br>
Two would have been coo,</br>
Two would have have worked til their faces were blue,</br>
Two would have had less merge conflict goo</br>

Mustafa,</br>
He did not travel as fa'</br>
He did not give up singing La La La</br>
He knew they needed one more member from the territory Kaw</br>

Three</br>
Three would have been four without me,</br>
Three would have been 1 short of perfect you see,</br>
Three would have worked, but what about me? </br>

Me</br>
I am Erik can't you see,</br>
I wish this class were free,</br>
I help the group with every need.</br>

Four</br>
No less no more
